      This is my HTML lab. It took several minutes for the lab to set up the VM workspace. I'm not sure what was going on there, so I took
      some time to create a new lab file in my local project folder on my laptop. I have created the structure and syntax. I added a DOCTYPE
      tag, html tag with English language attribute, head with title and body tag. I tried to make sure I had close tags on all the places
      that require it.

    <p>
      So I don't forget them while I wait for the Workspace VM to set up still - the requirements are:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Include at least one hyperlink using proper format.</li>
      <li>Include at least one image using proper format - include source attribute and alt text attribute.</li>
    </ol>

     I mentioned it in my notes, but I love pizza! And, living in Colorado, one of the best places to get a delicious pizza is from Beaujo's.
     My favorite is a <em>Motherlode</em> specialty mountain pie - mountain pies have their amazing thick crust. By the way, one of the
     special things about Beaujo's is their honey that you drizzle on the pizza crust. Here's an
     <a href="https://www.beaujos.com/how-sweet-it-is/"><strong>article</strong></a> talking about their honey sourcing and how special their
     honey is to their pizza.
